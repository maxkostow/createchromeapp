## Create a Google Chrome "application" for OSX
###### (a.k.a. another instance with a unique name/icon; a.k.a. Site Specific Browser (like Fluid))

#### Original README
> It's derived from [Bracken King's shell script][1], who deserves all the credit for the idea. I just wanted to make this functionality usable for a couple of friends who never want to see a terminal screen.  
> 
This is also my first real AppleScript attempt, so many things could probably be optimized, enhanced, etc. Feel free to do so.

Written and tested on Mac OS X 10.5.8 with Google Chrome 8.0.552.237

#### Requirements
1. Google Chrome

#### Usage
1. Run the app
2. Answer the questions

#### Things to consider
- Have a URL ready for pasting (or dragging). You can, of course, type it in manually as well.
- Optionally have an image ready for a nice application icon, it can be a JPEG, PNG, TIFF image or an .icns file. If using an image file, it should be a perfect square, ie. width=height, otherwise the icon generation probably fails.

#### Known issues:
- Sometimes the app icon will revert to the ChromeÂ icon. Just quit the instance and start it again to fix.
